          "One chracteristic that measures network performace is bandwidth. It measures value in two different context, one is bandwidth in hertz and other is bandwidth in bits per seconds. Bandwidth in hertz is the range of frequencies contained in a composite signal or the range of frequencies a channel can pass. In the terms of bits per second, it is the number of bits per second that a channel, a link or even a network can transmit."
